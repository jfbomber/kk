                <div>
                    Each of Kenya Keys’ programs and projects is very carefully selected and implemented. The
                    needs in Kenya are so vast and far reaching, it is difficult to determine which projects should come first.
                    Our projects are education-based and selected on the following considerations: 
                </div>

                <ol>
                    <li>Most urgent need determined by our Kenyan Board of Directors.
                        Whether it’s the need for a new school, latrines, scholarships, or aid to a micro business, no one
                        knows the needs better than the people that live with the needs. Projects are
                        determined and run from the ground up, developing a strong sense of accountability
                        and ownership.
                    </li>
                    <li>How can donors get “the biggest bang for the buck”?
                        What project will be able to benefit the most people for the dollars spent? What will the long term benefits be?
                        What needs to be considered in terms of maintenance and follow up?
                    </li>
                    <li>What controls have been put in to place to “follow the money”? 
                        This is a very important piece. It must be very clear up front what the budget for the project is and
                        how monies will be allocated and accounted for.
                    </li>
                    <li>Will the beneficiaries be able to meet the 10% commitment? For every project
                        Kenya Keys undertakes the recipients sign a Partnership Agreement and agree to
                        pay 10% or more of the costs. This seems impossible to apply in such an impoverished
                        area, but it is critical to ensure a sense of partnership, pride, and accountability. In-
                        kind contributions are the primary source of this 10% commitment.
